## Demo
### Basic testing of webauthn
Gives ok error messages
https://demo.yubico.com/webauthn-technical/registration

### A bit more advanced testing utility of webauthn
Gives absolutely no helpful error messages but it has more toggles
and you can actually specify a username
https://webauthn.io/

### Advanced testing utility
Very good error messages. Source code available to dig into errors.
Also supports discoverable credentials (resident keys) - though I haven't tested it yet.

## Communication debugging

## Demo/Communication debugging
Decodes all of the CBOR messages and displays them as JSON.
Very helpful to easily see what is actually communicated.
Also decodes the enum values inside the COSE wrapped keys

### CBOR Decode utility
If you need to create your own binary messages then this tool
is very helpful to actually understand the structure of the binary CTAP messages
