# Contexts

An async context is a way to group relevant actions together so that execution of one action affects
the execution of another. For example, if you have a form with a "Save" and "Delete" button, you
might want to disable the "Delete" button while the "Save" action is running, and vice versa.

## How to create a context

There are two way of creating a context, which one you use depends on your use case.

### Using `AsyncContextService`

To create a context, simply add `AsyncContextService` as a provider to your component:

```typescript
@Component({
  providers: [AsyncContextService],
})
```

### Using `bitAsyncContext` directive

> **Warning:** Not implemented yet

You can also use the `bitAsyncContext` directive to create a context, which is useful when you don't
want to create a whole new component just for the async context. The simplest example of this would
be a standalone button:

<Canvas of={AsyncContextStories.StandaloneButton} />

## When to create a context

You should create contexts around natural boundaries in your application. A place where changing one
thing will require updates to other things within the same boundary, or when actions need to be
atomic within that boundary.

## Nested contexts

All contexts are hierarchical, meaning that most contexts will be affected by a parent context. When
an action is run in a parent context, it will also disable actions in all child contexts. This means
that it is important to give careful consideration to creating sub-contexts for actions that are
able to run in parallel, so that we avoid blocking the entire application.

## Standard contexts

There are some standard contexts that are provided by the library:

### Root

The root context which all actions will run in by default. If you do not specify a context, your
action will run here and effectively disable all other async actions in the client.

### Dialog

> **Warning:** Not implemented yet

Dialogs are in a sense a sub-page of the application and provide a natural boundary in which actions
are usually scoped to. Dialogs there always create their own contexts and actions will only run in
the context of the dialog they were created in. The dialog service also subscribes to the context to
disable actions such as closing the dialog while an action is running.
