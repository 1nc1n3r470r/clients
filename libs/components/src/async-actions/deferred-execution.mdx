# Deferred Execution

Deferred execution is a method of moving the execution and definition of an async action to another
part of the application. This is useful for when you want to define a button that triggers an async
action in one place, but you want to define the handler in a different place. A common use case for
this is CL components, where the UI is defined by the library, but the action is defined by the
client.

## Basic Example

### Converting async action button to use deferred execution

To convert a button from using the regular async action to using deferred execution, all you need to
do is change the binding type from an `Input` to an `Output`. This will cause the button to not
execute the action when it is clicked, but instead emit a tagged event that you can listen to and
handle just like regular Angular `Output` events.
