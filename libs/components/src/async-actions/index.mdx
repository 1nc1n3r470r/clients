# Async Actions

The _Async Actions_ directives makes it easier for developers to reflect the progress of async
actions in the UI when using buttons, while also providing robust and standardized error handling.
These directives replaces the older `appApiAction` directive.

There are primarily two categories of _Async Actions_,
[in-form](?path=/docs/component-library-async-actions-in-forms--docs) for usage within a form, and
[standaline](?path=/docs/component-library-async-actions-standalone--docs) when used outside forms
on non form related actions.

<div class="!tw-mb-2">
  <Story of={stories.UsingPromise} />
</div>

## When to use?

When building a button that triggers a long running task in the background eg. server API calls.

## Why?

To better visualize that the application is processing their request.

## What does it do?

It disables buttons and show a spinning animation.
