# Dialogs

Bitwarden uses two differen type of dialogs depending on the scenario. For simple actions like
confirmation of user actions a simplified dialog is used, called _Simple Dialog_. For more complex
actions where additional information like forms, tabs, tables we use _Dialog_.

## Simple Dialog

Simple Dialogs consists of only an icon, title, description and one or two buttons. It uses a
simplified design language.
