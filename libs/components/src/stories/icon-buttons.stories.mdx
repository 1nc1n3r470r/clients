# Icon buttons

This is an example of design docs containing embedded stories.

### Example

Default primary buttons look like this

<Story id="component-library-icon-button--single" />

Sometimes this button can be used for refreshing, it will then have a loading state like this

**Note:** Specifying args doesn't seem to be supported when using embedded stories :(

<Story
  id="component-library-icon-button--single"
  args={{ loading: true, bitIconButton: "bwi-trash" }}
/>

Here is an example of all different types

<Story id="component-library-icon-button--all-default" />
